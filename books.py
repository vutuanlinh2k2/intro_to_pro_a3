        If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad 
        habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have 
        the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your

        The paperback edition of the legendary, record-breaking, best-selling fourth Harry Potter novel. Harry Potter 
        is midway through his training as a wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious
        Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup. He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's 
        supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a 
        competition that hasn't happened for a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But 
        unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards. And in his case, different can be 
        deadly.

        The war against Voldemort is not going well; even the Muggles have been affected. Dumbledore is absent 
        from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. 
        And yet . . . as with all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate. Teenagers flirt and fight 
        and fall in love. Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. And 
        with Dumbledore's guidance, he seeks out the full, complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort -- and 
        thus finds what may be his only vulnerability.

        Readers beware. The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling's spellbinding series is not for 
        the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 
        that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of 
        her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons 
        about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our 
        reviews--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an odyssey the 
        likes of which Rowling's fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did 
        not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissue.

        Although software has become easier to build, launching and scaling new products and services remains 
        difficult. Startups face daunting challenges entering the technology ecosystem, including stiff competition, 
        copycats, and ineffective marketing channels. Teams launching new products must consider the advantages 
        of “the network effect,” where a product or service’s value increases as more users engage with it. 
        Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other tech giants utilize network effects, and most tech products incorporate 
        them, whether they’re messaging apps, workplace collaboration tools, or marketplaces. Network effects provide 
        a path for fledgling products to break through, attracting new users through viral growth and word of mouth.
